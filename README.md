## What is Bot-Be-Named

A Discord bot that interoperates with Google Sheets to smoothen solving puzzle hunts. 

If you would like to add our instance of Bot-Be-Named to your server, please see below.

Bot-Be-Named is currently set up with our own configurations and environment variables, so might have assumptions that don't work for you. Please contact us if you need **a Bot invite link**, or to set up your own fork/instance of the bot.

## Inviting the Bot to your server

- Join the bot's discord server at `discord (dot) gg / x8f2ywHUky`

- There is an instance of the bot currently on that server, named `~Bot Be Named`. Click on that name - Add App - Add it to your discord server.  Note that you need "Manage Server" permission to do that.

- Use `~about` to get a quick guide to the bot, and `~startup` for all the commands that will come in very handy for you.

- In case of any problems, message us on discord or [open a new issue on Github](https://github.com/kevslinger/bot-be-named/issues/new)

## How to install your own instance

### Prerequisites - 

- [python3.10 or newer](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

- [Postgresql for storing data](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- [Pip package installer for Python](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows)

Note that you may use another Python installer (instead of Pip), Host (instead of Fly.io) or Database (instead of Supabase) but that will require you figuring out the required setup and configuation changes yourself.

While only the above are necessary to run the code when deployed, some OSes might require additional installations to also run locally. For example, on Ubuntu, you need - 
```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-common postgresql-client
```

### Installation

We recommend using [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to manage python packages for our repo. To clone the repo and install dependencies, run the following on the Command Line

```bash
#Clone the bot locally
git clone https://github.com/kevslinger/bot-be-named.git
cd bot-be-named
#Technically optional, but using virtualenv is usually a good idea
virtualenv venv -p=3.10 
#This installs all the python dependancies the bot needs
pip install -r requirements.txt && pre-commit install
```

The bot uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for storing data.

To run the bot locally, you will need a `.env` file which is used by [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to load `ENV` variables. Copy `.env.template` into `.env` with  

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

and fill in the blanks in order to get the bot running. You also need to set up the Postgresql database for the bot. If you're using Supabase, follow [any regular guide](https://docs.stacksync.cloud/guides/two-way-sync-salesforce-and-postgres/create-a-postgres-database-with-supabase-free-forever) for it then copy the full URI.

Once you do all that, run


```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python bot.py
```

and the bot will run on the supplied discord token's account.

### Hosting

Once you have the bot running and basic commands (like `~help`) run properly, you can host it externally. Our instance of the bot is [hosted on fly.io](https://dev.to/denvercoder1/hosting-a-python-discord-bot-for-free-with-flyio-3k19).

### Other useful things

You can set up automatic Continuous Deployment (CD) on Fly.io. [Follow the instructions here](https://dev.to/denvercoder1/hosting-a-python-discord-bot-for-free-with-flyio-3k19) 

### Using Heroku and Heroku Postgres for hosting.
The instructions for [hosting on Heroku](https://medium.com/@linda0511ny/create-host-a-discord-bot-with-heroku-in-5-min-5cb0830d0ff2) are linked. You may need the [heroku CLI client for hosting](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-install-heroku-cli-in-windows-pc-e3cf9750b4ae).

If you're using Heroku's PostgresSQL add-on instead, first [install the add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) then [set it up](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql) to attach your app to the Postgres. Now you can look at `Heroku - Dashboard - Resources - Add Ons` to look at the app on Heroku, and copy the URI given from Postgres add-on to the respective line in the `.env file`

If you have github + heroku, using Heroku's [Github integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) allows you to automatically push Github pushes to also deploy on Heroku. (Using `git push` to push to both Github and Heroku)

When deploying on heroku, any variables stored in .env locally cannot be pushed to any public repos. It's advisable to use [Heroku Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) to store them.
